UCLA CCN Lab
============

A collection of scripts that I worked on or used at the UCLA Center for Cognitive Neuroscience.

## backuppc_config

Scripts to automate (or revert) the process of setting up a computer as a BackupPC client.

## dcm_convert

Wrapper script for mri_convert and dicom_hdr with some extra options.

## headtracker

This contains the calibration script to zero out all values and the initialization of a Headtracker experiment.
Additional details about the project can be found at http://redmine.ccn.ucla.edu/projects/headtracker.

## helpful_scripts

Contains helpful 3rd party unix admin tools for cleaning junk files, adding user groups, and adding users.

## quota_report

This is meant to be set up as a scheduled task to inform lab managers when their group on the Hoffman2
computing cluster is getting close to the data storage limit.

## setup_subject

A set of server and client scripts for syncing project dicom data from a dicom server to a client (cluster).
These scripts sync the data, organize the project structure, convert the dicom files, and performs backups.

## stimulus_tests

A couple examples of MRI experiments with keyboard input using Matlab with the Psychtoolbox plugin.

## userquotas

Print out the disk usage of individuals of a group on the Hoffman2 cluster.
